# unobtainium
*Obtain the unobtainable: test code covering multiple platforms*

Unobtainium wraps [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) and
[Appium](https://github.com/appium/ruby_lib) in a simple driver abstraction
so that test code can more easily cover:

  - Desktop browsers
  - Mobile browsers
  - Mobile apps

Some additional useful functionality for the maintenance of test suites is
also added.

This gem is inspired by [LapisLazuli](https://github.com/spriteCloud/lapis-lazuli),
but vastly less complex, and aims to stay so.
