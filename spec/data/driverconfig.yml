# the hierarchy is root -> branch1 -> branch2 -> leaf
#
# We test
# a) having a base before its derived by ordering root before branch1
# b) having a base after its derived by ordering branch2 after leaf
# c) overrides by having leaf override the option from branch1
#
# so the order in this file has to be root -> branch2 -> branch1 -> leaf
